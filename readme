The goal of this project is to enable a recipe search via the Recipe Puppy
API. A basic html and css framework is created, and the API data is parsed
based upon user keyword search.

Visually, the website should contain a search box in the header, with a
horizontal rule line immediately beneath. Search results will be displayed
with thumbnail images in a series of boxes below the horizontal rule (the
wireframe indicates 8 boxes).

Functionally, the strategy is to set up a fetch to the API. This data is in
an array. The array is then parsed via a loop. The user will enter a keyword
in the search box. This search term must be appended to the following URL:
http://www.recipepuppy.com/api/?q=search-term (where "search-term" is replaced
by the user-entered keyword). The keyword will then be located in the array
using "array.prorotype.includes". Should the keyword be located within any
element of the API's array, the element will be added to index.html via
appendChild.
